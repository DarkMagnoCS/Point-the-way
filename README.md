Project Idea: Travel Itinerary Planner App
Concept:
A web app where users can log in via Google (OAuth2) and organize their travel plans. They can create detailed itineraries with schedules, accommodations, and activities. The app will also integrate with external travel APIs (e.g., for flights and hotels) to provide real-time updates.

Features:
OAuth2 Authentication (Google Sign-In):

Users log in with Google accounts using OAuth2.
Token-based authentication ensures session security.
Trip Planning Dashboard:

Users can create trips with details like destination, start and end dates, and a list of activities and accommodations.
Each trip can be broken down by days, and users can add activities (like sightseeing, dining, etc.) or reservations (flights, hotels, etc.) for each day.
CRUD Operations with MongoDB:

Create: Users add new trips with their itineraries, including flight information, hotel bookings, and activities.
Read: Display trips in a dashboard with categorized views for upcoming, current, and past trips.
Update: Users can modify trip details, including dates, activities, or accommodations.
Delete: Users can cancel or delete trips.
Real-time Travel API Integration:

Flight Information: Use APIs like Skyscanner, Amadeus, or FlightAware to pull real-time flight details such as pricing, availability, and status updates.
Hotel Booking: Integrate hotel data using APIs like Booking.com, Expedia, or Amadeus.
Show users available options based on their selected destination and dates.
User-Specific Data:

Each user can manage their own itineraries, and their travel information is stored securely in MongoDB.
Frontend:

Built with React and optimized for a user-friendly experience.
React Router for navigation between the dashboard, trip details, and trip creation screens.
Calendar-style interface for easy trip planning.
Responsive design, working well on mobile and desktop.
Backend:

Built with Django and Django REST Framework.
REST API to handle CRUD operations and integration with external APIs.
JWT-based authentication for API requests.
Optional Enhancements:
Activity Suggestions: Use a third-party API (like Google Places or Yelp) to suggest activities at the user's destination.
Budget Planner: Allow users to track expenses, add expected costs for activities, flights, and accommodations, and see the overall trip budget.
Notifications: Send email reminders for upcoming trips or changes in flight status.
Share Itineraries: Users can share their itineraries with others via a link.
